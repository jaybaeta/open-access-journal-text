This repo is a collection of the textual contents of various open access journals I've worked with. Its purpose is to serve as a central reference for the different (or similar) ways in which these journals communicate the same message. 

Because everything is licensed under a Creative Commons license, everything in this repo can be reused and copied, but proper attribution should be given to the respective author/journal. (But do note that copying a different journal's text wholesale is lazy.)

Some of the content of this repo might overlap with that found in these other repos:
